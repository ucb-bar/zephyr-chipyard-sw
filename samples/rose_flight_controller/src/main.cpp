 * Shared drone flight controller — one application, two targets.
 *
 * Sensor input goes through the STANDARD Zephyr sensor API (a named IMU / optical-flow /
 * ToF device via device-tree aliases), so this exact code runs:
 *   - in RoSE co-sim  : aliases bind to the virtual ucbbar,rose-* drivers (data over the
 *                       RoSE bridge from the Isaac Sim virtual sensors);
 *   - on real hardware: aliases bind to the real bosch,bmi08x-* / st,vl53l1x / flow
 *                       drivers over I2C/SPI (ESP32C6 "riskybird" board).
 * Only the board overlay + prj.conf differ; main, the estimator (IStateEstimator), and the
 * controller (IController) are byte-for-byte shared. See docs/ROSE_SENSOR_ABSTRACTION.md.
 *
 * The only target-specific code here is the actuator OUTPUT (a RoSE-bridge TX packet in
 * co-sim vs PWM motors on hardware) — actuator parity is future work; the sensor/estimator/
 * control path is fully shared.
 *
 * Per control step (200 Hz):
 *   1. sample_fetch/channel_get IMU (accel+gyro), optical flow, and (low-rate) ToF height
 *   2. estimator.update(...) -> 12-DoF state; ToF fused only on fresh samples (multi-rate)
 *   3. subtract the hover setpoint (regulate velocity, not the unobservable x/y position)
 *   4. controller.compute(...) -> 4 normalized motor thrusts -> actuator output
 *      (controller = TinyMPC by default, or hierarchical PID via -DROSE_USE_PID=1)

 * UPLINK COMMANDS OVER uart1 -- this carrier's substitute for a radio.

 * CONFIG_WIFI is never set in any flight_controller build, so every rose_cmd_*
 * hook below compiled out of every FPGA image, and workloads/esp_bridge was
 * left inventing its own "ACK" for commands that nothing on this end read.
 *

 * ROSE_UART_CMD is that reader. It changes no default behaviour on its own:
 * with no ground station attached nothing is ever received, and the commands it
 * can deliver are exactly the five the hooks already implemented.
 *
 * SAFETY DIRECTION. Of those five, ESTOP and DISARM only ever REMOVE authority
 * (latch the kill, clear the arm latch). HOVER_Z is clamped to
 * SAFE_MAX_HEIGHT_M by its hook. PROFILE only retimes a future flight. RESET is
 * the one that grants -- it sets g_arm_enabled -- and it grants exactly what a
 * tethered debugger already grants through hardware/flight/arm-enable.gdb. It
 * does NOT arm: the lift-and-place gesture, the gyro cal, the battery check and
 * the motor-commit gate all still stand between RESET and a spinning motor.
 *
 * SHARING uart1. This is the RX direction, and a UART receives on a different
 * wire than it transmits, so the reader cannot interleave with either of the
 * two TX writers whenever it runs. The ACK it writes back IS a third TX writer,
 * and that one is safe by the same argument the telemetry mirror uses below:

/* ---- What vbat= on the telemetry line MEANS ---------------------------------------------------
 *
 * This is the one field a REMOTE operator reads to decide whether a motor can physically turn.
 * The motors are brushed and switched by low-side SI2302 FETs straight off +BATT -- there are no
 * ESCs -- so what makes a motor turn is energy on +BATT and nothing else.
 *
 * READ THIS BEFORE BUILDING ANYTHING ON TOP OF vbat=. It is the +BATT RAIL VOLTAGE. It is NOT a
 * pack-presence flag, and on this board it CANNOT be made into one:
 *
 *   riskybirdv3.kicad_sch: U4 is an MCP73831-2 charger with VDD on +5V (USB VBUS, J8) and its VBAT
 *   output wired DIRECTLY to +BATT. The pack connector J7 lands on that same net. So with USB
 *   plugged and NO pack fitted, U4 charges the +BATT bulk capacitance (C2/C3/C40/C41 4x47uF plus
 *   C48 10uF, ~200uF) to its 4.20 V float and terminates -- and AIN5 reads a textbook healthy
 *   battery. An empty board on USB and a fully charged pack produce the SAME number here.
 *
 * What the number does tell you, truthfully: whether the rail the motor FETs switch is energised,
 * and roughly to what. What it cannot tell you: whether there is a pack behind that rail. ~200uF
 * at 4.2 V is a twitch, not a flight, but it is not "nothing", so a high vbat= must be read as
 * "the motor rail is live -- assume a motor can move" and never as "a pack is fitted". The one
 * discriminator that exists is load response (with no pack the rail collapses the instant a motor
 * draws current, because U4 can source only ~500 mA into ~200uF), and deliberately loading the
 * motors to find out is not something a remote, unattended build gets to do.
 *
 * So the field must never be ambiguous, and printing g_vbat raw is ambiguous three ways -- 0.000
 * means "sense not compiled in", "sense compiled in but the ADC has never answered", and "a
 * genuine zero" all at once. The first two are NOT KNOWLEDGE, and rendering them as a number that
 * compares below any "is the pack present" threshold turns "I have no idea" into a confident
 * "absent, motors cannot turn". Unknown must never render as safe.
 *
 * A voltage read through an unsigned 12-bit ADC cannot be negative, so the SIGN is free to carry
 * "this is not a measurement" with no possibility of colliding with a real reading:
 *
 *   vbat=-1.000   battery sense is NOT COMPILED IN (ROSE_BATT_SENSE=0). Nothing is known, and
 *                 nothing in this build will ever know it.
 *   vbat=-2.000   sense IS compiled in, but no valid sample has ever reached g_vbat: the ADS7128
 *                 is not answering on the ToF bus, or every conversion so far fell outside the
 *                 [0.5, 6.0] V plausibility window in battery_poll().
 *   vbat=<v>      a real, EMA-smoothed pack voltage.
 *
 * The sentinels are also chosen to fail safe in the tool that consumes them. tools/bench/
 * rb-status.sh scrapes this field with `grep -ao "vbat=[0-9.]*"`, which matches no digits at all
 * against a leading '-'; the field comes out EMPTY and the script takes its "UNKNOWN -- a remote
 * operator CANNOT tell if motors can spin" branch, instead of parsing 0.000 and printing a green,
 * confident, wrong "absent -- motors cannot turn".
 *
 * No parser breaks: riskybird_panel.py's floats are (-?\d+\.\d+), so TAIL_RE still matches and
 * the rest of the tail (vx/vy/vz/zsp/st) keeps parsing exactly as before. */

/* ===============================================================================================
 * THE 2026-09-21 TILT-GUARD FAILURE, AND WHAT WAS ACTUALLY WRONG
 * ===============================================================================================
 * Measured on the bench: the drone was rotated by hand to roughly 90 degrees while
 * `--mode esp-motors` was running, and nothing cut the motors. The console showed
 *
 *     it=1020  roll=-0.949  pitch=-0.029  duty=[0.100 0.100 0.100 0.100]
 *
 * and the ESP kept reporting flags=0x01 (ARMED) the whole way over.
 *
 * The estimator was NOT lagging and NOT mis-scaled. It was right, and it was MISREAD.
 *
 * state[3..5] are RODRIGUES (Gibbs) parameters, r = q_xyz / qw -- see estimator.hpp, and
 * ComplementaryEstimator::get_state() / EkfEstimator::get_state(), both of which divide the
 * quaternion vector part by qw. For a rotation of theta about one axis that is
 *
 *     r = tan(theta / 2)
 *
 * so the reported -0.949 is a true roll of 2*atan(0.949) = 1.518 rad = 87.0 DEGREES. That is the
 * ~90 degrees the operator applied, to within how well anyone eyeballs 90 degrees. The estimator
 * tracked the rotation correctly.
 *
 * What failed is that safety_violation() compared that Gibbs number against a constant named
 * SAFE_MAX_TILT_RAD as though it were radians. 1.0 in Gibbs units is tan(theta/2) = 1, i.e.
 * theta = 90.0 DEGREES EXACTLY -- not the ~57 degrees its own comment claimed. The guard's real
 * trip point was 90 degrees and the operator reached 87. It missed by three degrees, and the
 * comment had been describing a limit the code did not have since the constant was written.
 *
 * The same misreading was in the arm gate: ARM_MAX_TILT_RAD 0.10 "(~5.7 deg)" is really
 * 2*atan(0.1) = 11.4 degrees.
 *
 * The codebase already knew, in one place. read_sensor_frame()'s flow tilt-compensation derives
 * cos(tilt) from "the Gibbs state" with (1 - ga^2 - gb^2 + gc^2)/(1 + ga^2 + gb^2 + gc^2); put
 * ga = 0.949 through it and it returns 0.052, which is cos(87.0 deg). Two independent routes to
 * the same answer, so this is not a guess.
 *
 * THE FIX IS IN THREE PARTS, because one would not have been enough:
 *
 *   1. Convert. tilt_rad_from_gibbs() turns the state into actual radians, once, and every
 *      attitude limit now compares radians against radians. The constants finally mean what they
 *      are named.
 *   2. Do not depend on the estimator at all for the handling case. accel_envelope() reads the
 *      accelerometer directly -- gravity is a true attitude reference with no filter, no
 *      convergence and no parameterisation to misread -- and adds FREE FALL and IMPACT, which
 *      NOTHING in this file had. Tilt cannot catch a drop: a drone dropped flat stays flat the
 *      whole way down and only |a| gives it away. The approach and the thresholds were taken from
 *      riskybird's standalone bench motor-guard module, which has since been DELETED from that
 *      tree as an unreferenced duplicate of the upstream watchdog; see the note on
 *      accel_envelope() for why a separate module was never linked in here anyway. This file is
 *      now the only copy of those tests and thresholds.
 *   3. Debounce in MILLISECONDS, not iterations. SAFE_DEBOUNCE_ITERS was 15 consecutive iterations,
 *      which is 20 ms under the PID cascade (1.3 ms/iter) and 525 ms under TinyMPC (35 ms/iter) --
 *      a factor of TWENTY-SIX between two builds of the same guard, and the offload run that
 *      failed was the slow one. A brisk tilt-and-return cannot outlast half a second. Time is the
 *      unit that means the same thing in both builds.
 *
 * WHAT THE ACCELEROMETER GUARD IS AND IS NOT GOOD AT, stated so nobody over-trusts it. It reads
 * SPECIFIC FORCE. Sitting still or hovering, that is gravity and the tilt it reports is true. In a
 * hard translational acceleration the thrust vector dominates and body-frame horizontal accel
 * stays small even at a real tilt, so it UNDER-reports during aggressive flight -- which is
 * exactly where the estimator-based check is strong. They are a complementary pair on purpose, and
 * the direction test is skipped entirely while |a| is outside a plausible band, because the
 * direction of a vector that is not gravity says nothing about attitude.

/* Trust the accelerometer's DIRECTION only inside this band. Outside it, |a| is not gravity and the
 * two magnitude tests above own the case.
 *
 * WHETHER TO WIDEN THIS WAS THE HARDEST CALL IN THE 2026-09-21 SAFETY AUDIT, because this band is
 * the one place a test in this guard can switch itself off, and prop vibration is exactly what
 * pushes |a| out of it. The decision is NOT TO WIDEN. The reasoning, in full, so that the next
 * person to reach for these numbers argues with it rather than guessing at it:
 *
 * WHAT IS STILL TRUE OUTSIDE THE BAND. Free-fall and impact are magnitude tests evaluated BEFORE
 * this check, so they never stop. est tilt, rate, velocity and height are computed after this
 * returns, from the estimator and the gyro, and never touch this path. Exactly ONE of the seven
 * tests suspends -- the accelerometer's DIRECTION -- and the estimator's tilt covers the same
 * failure by a different route. That is not a hole; it is a degradation to six tests from seven.
 * On the bench it was the estimator test that actually fired ("47.457 deg est-tilt") precisely
 * BECAUSE hand-tilting the frame had pushed |a| out of this band. The pair works.
 *
 * WHY WIDENING WOULD NOT BUY WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IT BUYS. Outside the band |a| is not gravity, so
 * asin(|horiz|/|a|) is not attitude. Under thrust- or vibration-dominated |a| the horizontal part
 * stays small relative to a LARGER total, so the formula UNDER-reports the tilt. A widened band
 * therefore does not gain a test that trips; it gains a test that reads a plausible small number
 * and does not trip. Against a limit, "absent" and "silently under-reporting" fail identically.
 *
 * WHY WIDENING WOULD ACTIVELY COST SOMETHING. g_guard_tilt_rad is what the telemetry line prints
 * as accNdeg, and the whole pre-flight proof that the guard is alive is "tilt the frame by hand and
 * watch acc follow" -- see docs/tethered-flight-attempt.md. Suspended, it publishes pi, which
 * prints as acc180deg: an unmistakable "I do not know". Widened, it would publish a believable
 * wrong angle instead. Trading an honest refusal for a plausible fiction is the wrong trade in a
 * device whose previous failure was a guard that looked like it was working.
 *
 * WHAT THE MEASUREMENT SAYS. Props ON, on the bench: |a| ranged 7.85 .. 12.46 m/s^2 and 0 of 44
 * samples fell outside this band. It was not being hit. The honest caveat is that this was at the
 * 10 % bench cap, and nobody has sampled |a| at the 65-75 % duty a tethered hover needs.
 *
 * SO INSTEAD OF WIDENING, MAKE IT COUNTABLE. g_guard_acc_skips counts every sample the direction
 * test sits out. At rest it stays 0; if it climbs with props spinning, the accelerometer test is
 * effectively off and the estimator test is carrying the attitude envelope alone -- which is a
 * thing to know and act on, not a thing to hide behind a wider band. The telemetry line and
 * hardware/flight/guard-check.gdb both report it. */

 * Per-motor duty ceiling in flight. READ THIS BEFORE BELIEVING THE DEFAULT.
 *
 * The comment that used to sit on this line said "hover~0.15; margin above". That is wrong, and
 * it is wrong in the dangerous direction. 0.15 is MOTOR_BREAKAWAY_DUTY, ~90 lines down: the duty
 * at which a motor first turns at all. It was evidently copied here and nothing about this
 * airframe supports it as a hover figure. There are three numbers in this tree claiming to be
 * hover duty and they differ by about 5x:
 *
 *   0.583  the CONTROLLER'S LINEARISATION POINT, not a measurement. It is the +0.583f in
 *          actuator_duty() and the box TinympcController::init() builds around it
 *          (u_min -0.583, u_max 1-0.583). It says what the controller ASSUMES hover is.
 *   0.71   MEASURED IN FLIGHT. docs/FLIGHT_TUNING_LOG.md, platform line: "~71 % hover duty, raw
 *          command saturating 42-65 % of the flight". Those flights ran with
 *          AUTOFLIGHT_MAX_DUTY=0.95 (same file) and docs/FLIGHT_BUILD.md's recipe passes 0.8f
 *          with the note "hover needs ~65%".
 *   0.15   the copied break-away number. Not a hover duty at all.
 *
 * So 0.45 IS PROBABLY BELOW HOVER, and a ceiling below hover does not make a gentle flight: the
 * anti-saturation cut holds the collective at the ceiling, the drone sits on the ground at full
 * command, and the honest-looking console shows every motor pinned. The reaction that costs an
 * airframe is to assume something is broken and start raising limits in a hurry. Raise this
 * deliberately, in one step, having decided the number first -- 0.8f is what the recorded flight
 * recipe used.
 *
 * The default is left at 0.45 rather than raised here: it is the conservative direction, it is
 * what every existing autoflight build has been tested against, and a flight cap is not
 * something a file edit should hand out. The #pragma below makes the situation impossible to

/* ---- COMMITMENT GATE -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * THE REQUIREMENT, in the operator's words: "make sure we have reliable ways of stopping and
 * motors dont spin for too long until we are COMMITTED (meaning im actively aware) to a flight
 * test." Two separate things: stopping must be reliable, and an UNCOMMITTED build must not be
 * able to run motors for long. Everything else in this file -- estop, the arm gate, the duty
 * ceilings, the bench actuation timeout -- answers the first. This answers the second.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NEEDED AT ALL. In every non-autoflight mode g_armed is a compile-time `true`, so a
 * board that boots `--mode motors` or `--mode esp-motors` is armed from its first control tick.
 * The controller regulates to TARGET_Z, so it asks for thrust immediately and keeps asking for as
 * long as the loop runs -- CTRL_ITERS iterations, or forever with CTRL_ITERS=0. The only bound was
 * ROSE_ACTUATE_TIMEOUT_MS, which DEFAULTS TO 0 = never (see the CMake cache entry), so the default
 * build had no time bound on motor output whatsoever.
 *
 * THE DEFAULT. Motors may run for ROSE_MOTOR_WINDOW_MS (5 s) measured from the first instant a
 * non-zero duty would actually have been written. Then all four are commanded to 0 and LATCHED --
 * whatever the controller asks for afterwards, and whatever the arm gate says. 5 s is chosen to be
 * long enough to hear each motor spin up and see a duty in telemetry, and far too short to fly.
 *
 * COMMITTING, and why it cannot happen by accident. It takes TWO independent acts:
 *
 *   1. BUILD TIME  -DROSE_FLIGHT_COMMIT=1. Deliberately NOT selected by any --mode (see
 *      tools/rb/boards.py): no mode name can quietly imply it, so it has to be typed, as
 *      RB_CMAKE_ARGS="-DROSE_FLIGHT_COMMIT=1". Without it, g_flight_commit_key below is not
 *      compiled at all -- so the run-time act is not merely refused, the symbol does not exist and
 *      the GDB script fails with "No symbol". That absence is the proof the image cannot fly.
 *
 *   2. RUN TIME    the operator writes ROSE_COMMIT_KEY into g_flight_commit_key from a tethered
 *      debugger (hardware/flight/commit.gdb), on the bench, with the drone in front of them. It is
 *      a specific 32-bit constant, so neither uninitialised RAM, nor a stray `set var x = 1`, nor a
 *      wild store can produce it; and it is polled, not latched at boot, so it cannot survive into
 *      a later session.
 *
 * Neither act alone does anything. A committed image that is never keyed behaves exactly like the
 * default. A key written into an uncommitted image has nowhere to land.
 *
 * Committed, the window becomes ROSE_COMMIT_MAX_MS (60 s) rather than unbounded: a commitment is
 * permission for A FLIGHT TEST, not permission forever. FLIGHT_MAX_MS (10 s) still ends an
 * autoflight long before this, so the 60 s is the backstop for the backstop.
 *
 * ANNOUNCED, ALWAYS. "Actively aware" is the requirement, so every transition prints: the banner at
 * boot, the window opening on the first live duty, a 1 Hz heartbeat while motors may run, the
 * latch, the commit being accepted or refused, and a soft reset that does NOT clear the latch. A
 * state the console does not name is a state the operator is not aware of.
 *
 * WHAT THE GATE DOES NOT COVER, said plainly: the autoflight boot/ready chirps drive PWM directly
 * rather than through send_control(), so they do not open the window. They are bounded by
 * construction (MOTOR_CHIRP_MS per pulse, six pulses) and are the signal that the board reset,
 * which is itself a safety feature. There is no chirp at all on the ESP-offload path.

 * controller can respond and be observed, but CANNOT produce flight thrust.
 * Raise deliberately only for actual flight testing.
 *
 * IT IS A SCALE, NOT A CLAMP, and the difference decides whether a flight build
 * can hover. actuator_duty() MULTIPLIES by it (the loop at the end of that
 * function); the clamp on the following line only catches the already
 * impossible. So every duty -- collective AND differential -- is multiplied by
 * this number. Thrust goes as roughly duty^2, so a cap of s gives about s^2 of
 * full thrust while leaving the torque/thrust ratio unchanged, which is what
 * makes it a usable power limiter rather than something that eats attitude
 * authority. What it also means: the PID altitude loop has no integrator, so it
 * cannot claw the scale back. A cap below the real hover duty is a drone that
 * sits on the floor at full command, not a drone that climbs slowly.
 *
 * IT IS NOT THE ONLY CEILING. On the ESP-offload path the last word belongs to
 * ESP_MOTORS_MAX_DUTY_PCT in workloads/esp_motors (default 25 %), applied in
 * motors_apply() after the frame arrives, and it deliberately does not trust
 * this side. Raising only this one is silently clamped there and looks exactly
 * like a thrust failure or a tuning problem. See the check under
 * ROSE_ESP_MOTORS below, which is there to make that mistake noisy.
 *
 * These three knobs used to live inside the `#if DT_NODE_EXISTS(MOTORS_NODE)`
 * block below, with MOTOR_MAX_DUTY doubly #ifndef-guarded so that a build which
 * already defined it (every build does -- the CMakeLists passes all three)
 * skipped the break-away and chirp defaults too. Hoisted and de-nested here
 * because the ESP-offload backend needs the same numbers and must not carry a

/* ---- MOTOR_MAX_DUTY IS A SCALE, NOT A CLAMP -- and why a second knob exists.
 *
 * Read actuator_duty() below before setting either of these for a flight test.
 * On the bench (non-autoflight) path MOTOR_MAX_DUTY is applied as the LAST
 * step, as a MULTIPLIER on a duty that is already physical:
 *
 *     duty[i] = (u[i] + 0.583) ... anti-saturation cut at 1.0 ... * MOTOR_MAX_DUTY
 *
 * That is right for a propellers-off bench run -- every motor still responds
 * and the differential is visible at a duty too low to lift anything -- and it
 * is WRONG as a flight cap, for a reason that is easy to miss and expensive to
 * discover with props on:
 *
 *   the controller's output IS the physical duty it wants. u + 0.583 round-trips
 *   controller_pid.cpp's forceToVoltage() exactly. Hover on this airframe needs
 *   ~0.65-0.71 duty (FLIGHT_BUILD.md: "hover needs ~65%"; FLIGHT_TUNING_LOG.md:
 *   "~71 % hover duty"). Set MOTOR_MAX_DUTY to 0.75 "as a 75 % cap" and the
 *   motors get 0.71 * 0.75 = 0.53 at the controller's hover command -- about
 *   55 % of hover THRUST, since thrust goes as duty^2. The drone cannot hover.
 *   Worse, it does not fail cleanly: while the altitude error is large the loop
 *   saturates, the scaled command sits at 0.75 and the drone climbs hard; as it
 *   approaches the setpoint the command falls back toward 0.71, the scale bites,
 *   and thrust collapses. That is a porpoise, with props on, on a tether.
 *
 * MOTOR_DUTY_CEILING is the knob that means what "cap" sounds like. It replaces
 * the hard-coded 1.0 the bench path's ATTITUDE-PRIORITY ANTI-SATURATION cut
 * works against, so exceeding it lowers the COLLECTIVE and preserves the
 * differential -- the same semantics AUTOFLIGHT_MAX_DUTY already has on the
 * autoflight path, and the reason a per-motor clamp is the wrong tool here (a
 * clamp flattens four commands into four equal numbers = no attitude authority,
 * exactly when the vehicle is asking for the most thrust).
 *
 * Default 1.0f, so every existing build is bit-identical: the cut compares
 * against 1.0 as before and no clamp fires below it.
 *
 * FOR A TETHERED FLIGHT ATTEMPT the pair is:
 *
 *     RB_CMAKE_ARGS="-DMOTOR_MAX_DUTY=1.0f -DMOTOR_DUTY_CEILING=0.75f"
 *
 * Both are CMake cache variables listed in target_compile_definitions (see
 * CMakeLists.txt), so RB_CMAKE_ARGS is what reaches them; a bare -D of a name
 * that is NOT listed there is discarded, which is the trap that CMakeLists
 * already documents for PID_MASS_KG and CS_GPIO_PIN. Cache variables also
 * PERSIST in a build tree, so use --pristine always when switching a build tree
 * between a flight configuration and a bench one, and read the value back off
 * the DUTY CHAIN boot banner rather than trusting the command line.
 *
 * AND IT IS NOT THE LAST CEILING. workloads/esp_motors applies its own,
 * ESP_MOTORS_MAX_DUTY_PCT (default 25 %), in the last component before the
 * gate, and it does not trust this image. Raising only these two still clamps
 * at 25 % at the ESP and looks exactly like a thrust failure. See

 *
 * WHAT A STALLED MOTOR ACTUALLY COSTS, corrected. An earlier version of this
 * comment said the motor's ESC latches locked-rotor protection and that only
 * removing power clears it. THERE ARE NO ESCs ON THIS AIRFRAME. The motors are
 * brushed, driven low-side by SI2302 FETs straight off the pack; there is no
 * controller in between to latch anything. The hazard is real but different: a
 * stalled brushed motor is very nearly a short across the pack through the FET,
 * dissipating in the winding and the channel with no rotation to cool either.
 * It heats in seconds. So the rule is unchanged -- do not command a duty below
 * break-away -- but the reason is thermal, the damage is cumulative rather than
 * a latch, and NOTHING clears itself when you power-cycle. Do not leave the
 * drone sitting at a sub-break-away duty while you read the console.
 *
 * ALSO: 15% IS AN FPGA-PATH NUMBER. It was measured with the FPGA driving the
 * gates, and all three of the things that set it have changed under
 * ROSE_ESP_MOTORS: the gate is now driven from the ESP's 3.3 V through its own
 * 47R rather than from FPGA VCCO through the FPGA's, which is a different V_GS
 * on the SI2302; the FPGA path's motor outputs are INVERTED in the generated
 * Verilog and nobody has re-derived whether a commanded duty was the duty the
 * gate saw; and the quantisation differs (sifive comparator 1/2500 vs LEDC
 * 11-bit). Treat 0.15 as an order of magnitude on the offload path, not as a
 * measurement, until it is re-measured there with workloads/motor_duty.
 *
 * This is a property of the airframe, not of the code. Re-measure it after any
 * motor or wiring change: drive each motor alone, step the duty up, and take
 * the highest value at which any of them first turns -- then leave margin.

 * four gates and generates the PWM. See the protocol header for the frame, the
 * latency budget and the resynchronisation rule.
 *
 * Why there is no PWM here at all: ball F13, motor4's gate driver, is dead as an
 * output. A bare-metal bitstream driving the four pads at 4/8/12/16 % reads back
 * M1=40 M2=80 M3=120 M4=0 per mille at the gates, and the same ball configured
 * as an input reads the carrier's 10k pulldown -- so the net is fine and the IOB
 * is not. Handing only motor4 to the ESP would leave the other three gates
 * driven by two 47R sources at once; handing over all four removes that as well.
 *
 * SAFETY, and specifically how this is BETTER than what it replaces. The SiFive
 * PWM comparators are free-running hardware: halting the Rocket core -- which
 * `rb debug` does every session -- leaves them driving the gates at the last
 * programmed duty, forever, until a reconfigure or a power cycle. Nothing in the
 * current design stops that. Here, a halted core simply stops emitting frames,
 * and the ESP cuts all four motors after its receive timeout. A crash, a reset
 * and an unplugged ribbon all behave the same way.
 *
 * "Off" is also sent EXPLICITLY rather than being left to the timeout: while
 * disarmed, estopped, past the bench actuation timeout, or built with motors
 * inhibited, this still transmits a frame -- with duty 0 and the ARMED bit
 * clear -- so the receiver distinguishes "commanded off" from "link dead".

 * THE THREADED BLOCKS HAVE NO ENVELOPE GUARD. Refuse to build them against a real actuator.
 *
 * io_block() reads a frame, hands it to est_block()/ctrl_block() and calls send_control() --
 * and that is the whole pipeline. safety_violation() is called from exactly one place in this
 * file, the single-loop control loop in main(); grep it. So -DROSE_THREADED=1 on a board that
 * can drive motors produces an image that commands thrust with NO accel-tilt, free-fall,
 * impact, est-tilt, rate, velocity or height check anywhere in the path -- and nothing at run
 * time says so, because safety_banner() is called from main() before the blocks start, so the
 * ENVELOPE GUARD banner still prints at boot. A guard that announces itself and is then never
 * evaluated is worse than no guard at all.
 *
 * The first hard requirement for a tethered flight attempt is that the watchdog is ALWAYS on.
 * This is the one build knob that could silently clear it, so it is refused at compile time
 * rather than documented. ROSE_THREADED is not set by any --mode (see tools/rb/boards.py) and
 * its cache default is 0, so this cannot fire by accident -- only a hand-written RB_CMAKE_ARGS
 * can reach it, which is exactly the case worth catching, since a flight build already has to
 * pass RB_CMAKE_ARGS for -DROSE_FLIGHT_COMMIT=1.
 *
 * HAVE_ROSE (co-sim) is exempt: there is no physical motor there, the RoSE actuator is a
 * bridge packet, and the threaded blocks exist to be debugged against the lockstep protocol.
 *
 * To lift this, MOVE the guard rather than deleting the check: the estimator state and the raw
 * accel/gyro must reach a guard evaluation on the same path that reaches send_control(), i.e.
 * inside io_block() or ctrl_block(), latching g_estop as the single loop does.

 * On riskybird v3 the BMI088 (U3) is on the BOARD BOTTOM, rotated 180 deg, so its sensor axes do
 * NOT equal the drone body frame; raw readings must be rotated before the estimator uses them.
 *
 * Derivation (datasheet BST-BMI088-DS001 rev 1.9 + this layout + "pin 1 faces +x,+y"):
 *   - Accel & gyro SHARE one coordinate system (datasheet Fig 12 labels both on one axis triad),
 *     so the SAME rotation applies to both.
 *   - Pin-1 sits at the sensor's (+X,+Y) corner (datasheet Table 15: landscape/pin-top-left reads
 *     +1g on X, so +X and +Y meet at the pin-1 corner).
 *   - Bottom-side mount => the marking/top face points DOWN => sensor +Z = drone -Z. This part is
 *     CERTAIN: the estimator wants body accel_z = +9.81 at rest (az_w = R*a - GRAVITY); with +Z
 *     facing down the part reads -9.81 on +Z, so negating Z yields the required +9.81.
 *   - Pin-1's (+X,+Y) diagonal is aligned to the drone (+x,+y) diagonal; the bottom-side mirror
 *     then resolves the in-plane part to a SWAP (proper rotation, det +1):
 *       body_x = +sensor_y ,  body_y = +sensor_x ,  body_z = -sensor_z
 *
 * VERIFIED ON HARDWARE 2026-08-06 via the ROSE_IMU_DEBUG tilt test (all six channels correct;
 * accel uses the +g-up / specific-force convention, so the axis tilted UP reads POSITIVE):
 *   level at rest        -> accel ~ (0, 0, +9.6)                       [observed +9.6]
 *   tilt NOSE-UP         -> accel_x positive; gyro_y transient NEGATIVE [ax +6.9, gy -0.85]
 *   tilt RIGHT-WING-DOWN -> accel_y positive; gyro_x transient positive [ay +7.0, gx +0.88]
 *   yaw NOSE-LEFT (+y)   -> gyro_z positive                            [gz +1.06]
 * If the board is ever re-spun and a channel changes, fix the SRC index / SIGN below and re-run the

 *                              ToF thread and the loop, so it contends with nothing.
 *   mid-hover photo_step()     rb_camera_arm(): four register writes, no I2C, no printk. The core
 *                              then records one frame (~118 ms at FRAME_LEN 4000, ~30 ms at the
 *                              photo modes' 1000) by itself and holds it; every later pixel is
 *                              discarded, so the sensor may keep streaming for the rest of the flight.
 *   disarmed  photo_finish()   sensor standby over I2C, then ~79k register reads to drain the frame
 *                              into rose_photo_pixels[]. Only once the motors are off (landed, flight
 *                              cap, ESTOP) -- never in flight.
 * The frame then sits in DDR until `rb fly photo` (hardware/flight/photo.gdb) halts the core and
 * dumps it over JTAG. Everything a dump needs is in the rose_photo_* globals, C linkage, so the gdb
 * script reads them by name. State values are part of that contract:
 *   0 off, 1 preparing, 2 ready (streaming), 3 armed, 4 captured (in the core), 5 drained OK;
 *  -1 prepare failed, -2 capture incomplete, -3 drain failed (stage/detail say why).
 * ROSE_PHOTO_BENCH_AFTER_MS > 0 is the bench test: arm that long after boot while DISARMED and
 * finish as soon as the frame is in, so prepare -> arm -> finish -> dump is proven with the pack
 * out before any flight depends on it.

 * correctly -- so the control path was fine and the sensor produced no pixel clock. camera.c's
 * sequence is the one bootup_check passes 20/20 with; what differs here is the context:
 *   - the sensor is never reset, and nothing power-cycles it between loads (a failed prepare even
 *     leaves it streaming while the next `rb fly load` stops MCLK by reprogramming the FPGA);
 *   - i2c0 runs at 400 kHz (flight_controller.overlay); every camera success was at 100 kHz;
 *   - board_sensor_init() holds ADS7128 GPIO1-4 LOW push-pull, where bootup_check's camera stage
 *     streams with GPIO0-6 released (cam_status_led_on() rewrites PIN_CFG/GPIO_CFG to 0x80, which
 *     the photo modes compile out with RB_CAMERA_STATUS_LED=0).
 * So each try resets the sensor at 100 kHz; from try ROSE_PHOTO_RELEASE_XSHUT_TRY on it also
 * releases the side-ToF XSHUT lines (unused without ROSE_BUMPER; the down ToF is already at 0x30,
 * so the sides waking at 0x29 contend with nothing). camera.c's early PCLK check (CMakeLists,
 * RB_CAMERA_EARLY_PCLK_MS) makes a dead try cost ~0.3 s instead of the 6 s settle. The console
 * line "PHOTO: try N/M" of the try that passes names what fixed it. Each knob is a -D to bisect.

			 *     not exist at all -- io_block() only actuates -- so there is no

			 *     is in the FIFO. There is no buffering layer that could reorder them
			 *     and no yield point inside either writer.
			 *   - NOTHING ELSE opens esp-uart. The down-ToF, flow, side-ToF,

			 *
			 * So a duty frame can never be split by a telemetry write: the two are
			 * strictly sequential, not merely unlikely to collide. The one build that
			 * WOULD break this -- the console pointed at esp-uart while duty frames
			 * are on it -- is refused at compile time by the check next to
			 * ROSE_ESP_MOTORS's esp-uart #error above.
			 *
			 * The other direction is the receiver's problem and is already solved:
			 * workloads/esp_bridge demux_feed() holds the text back by exactly one
			 * frame length and RETRACTS those bytes when the sliding-window decoder
			 * accepts a frame, because a duty field can legitimately contain 0x0A and
